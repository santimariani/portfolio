          My very first project, <span className="italics">100 Days to Victory</span> is a text-based RPG (Role Playing Game) that made me fall in love with coding. Already from the start, I find myself seeking to add pleasing, cinematic-esque elements, yet also math and logic for a deep and engaging user experience. I'm simply hooked!
