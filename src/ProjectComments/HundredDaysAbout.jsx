          My very first project, <span className="italics">100 Days to Victory</span> is a text-based Role Playing Game that made me fall in love with coding. Already from the start, I found myself seeking to add pleasing, cinematic elements, yet also math and logic to create a fun user experience. In a special way, I enjoyed creating the fighting mechanics and enemy "Artificial Intelligence" that made the game come to life from scratch. A spark was ignited within me — and a coding journey joyfully began!
