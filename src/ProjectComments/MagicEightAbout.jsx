        For my second project, I began to explore the world of CSS{" "}
        <span className="italics">transformations</span>, going far beyond what
        was strictly demanded to complete the class requirements — so eager was
        I to learn ever more! Imagination became my ally as I sought to merge
        the visual concepts of "Eight Ball" with that of "space event horizon."
        And so, by using JavaScript{" "}
        <span className="italics">event listeners</span>, I began to feel like a
        Green Lantern, able to bring <span className="italics">anything</span>{" "}
        into existence. My love for code deepened. We journeyed on!
