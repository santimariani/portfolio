          <span className="italics">Ultimate Fighter II</span> is an ode to the moment I fell in love with coding: the Python RPG! The capstone project to my bootcamp experience, I took the initiative to integrate an obscure JavaScript gaming technology (Phaser) into a mainstream, more work related one (React). This allowed me to both create a working game complete with sounds and effects, and a sleek/unique UI in the form of a console as well. A first for the <span className="italics">Carolina Code School</span>, I was happy to blaze a new trail!
