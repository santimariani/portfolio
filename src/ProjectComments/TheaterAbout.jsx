        Continuing a trend, I went further into animation by creating a visual theater that connected to an Online Movie Database — my third project challenge! Each chair was added in keeping with the artistic concept of single point perspective, with rattling popcorn randomizing the next movie selection and a movie reel turning off the theater lights. Animations and sound thus began to come together to create a holistic experience. Video, however, was yet to be found!
