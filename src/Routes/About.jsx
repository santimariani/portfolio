        My name is Santi, a full-stack developer with a deep love for beauty and
        logic, a curious eye for innovation and problem-solving, and an
        insatiable appetite for continual learning and growth.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        An alumnus of the <span className="italics">Carolina Code School</span>,
        I learned to quickly absorb new technologies and to recognize those
        software patterns that are helping me take my ambitions beyond the
        classroom walls.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        User experience is at the forefront of my every project — unique
        interfaces, an ever-passionate goal. And beyond the visible, I enjoy
        employing sound logic and best principles to create solid apps that go
        above-and-beyond!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>

        continue the 'techy' branch of my bio, step over to my{" "}

        With the essentials taken care of, feel free now to keep on reading at
        your own peril, for to do so will mean going knee-deep into the realm of
        Santi Lore. Think twice before doing it! Yet not thrice, lest drama
        queens get bored.

        <span className="bold">"DON'T CRY FOR ME..."</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Originally born in Argentina (
        <span className="italics">hablo español</span>), I moved to the United
        States in 1996 with my parents and one brother, falling in love with my
        new home. While learning a new language had its immense challenges, it
        taught me the importance of consistency and rewarded me with the
        capacity to understand life through two diverse cultural "modes." As an
        immigrant family, we learned to take nothing for granted — there were no
        generational hand-me-downs; only what could be earned through sweat,
        sacrifice, and hard work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Despite the language barrier, I graduated from Spartanburg High School
        as a Palmetto Fellow Scholar, being in the top 3% of my class. I took
        voice lessons and was <span className="italics">painfully</span>{" "}
        socially awkward. Above all, I made friendships that, since then, have
        only grown. I am one fortunate soul!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">ENTER—WOFFORD</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        One of my greatest joys in these early years is having attended Wofford
        College, majoring <span className="italics">summa cum laude</span> in
        Finance. As a student leader through the Success Initiative program, I
        began to understand the fundamentals of entrepreneurship. To solve a
        communication gap, I created an online forum — saving the program
        thousands of dollars. For this and other endeavors, I earned{" "}
        <span className="italics">
          Dr. James Proctor Award for Innovation, Creativity, and
          Entrepreneurship
        </span>
        ... and a trend for creative problem-solving was born!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        (I also continued performing as a singer during this time and was even
        the protagonist in a children's opera,{" "}
        <span className="italics">Sid the Serpent Who Wanted to Sing</span>. But
        as I had to wear a leotard for this one, we do not talk about this, nay,
        not even in whispers. Who even -is- this Sid fellow of old?!)
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Balancing my creative outlets, my financial classes helped me to look at
        challenges through a more analytical mindset. Attention to detail became
        a constant necessity, the application of mathematics a daily must. "How
        boring," some might say. Yet I loved every moment of it! And so I earned
        the{" "}
        <span className="italics">
          Departmental Award for Academic Achievement, Scholarly Promise, and
          Intellectual and Moral Integrity
        </span>
        . I am thus undeniably and irrevocably a 100% certifiable (and
        certified!) nerd, geek, and dork.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">TWO ROADS DIVERGE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Concluding my time at Wofford, I was selected to intern at the Aspen
        Institute — a first for Wofford. There, I met world leaders and
        supported the operations of this globally renowned think-tank. On the
        one hand, I was amazed by the human capacity for progress. On the other,
        I noticed how many of the world's wealthiest still grappled for deeper
        meaning.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        "We have everything yet are still unhappy," it was mentioned at a
        private gathering. Until then, I had aspired to be 'financially free.'
        This was why I was majoring in finance, why I poured myself into every
        project, why I had even accepted the internship to begin with...
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Yet after hearing that admission, I was forever a changed man, feeling
        like I had been spared decades of mindless wandering. My heart thus
        embarked on a different adventure. A new path became trod.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">IN PURSUIT OF A GREATER LOVE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Much could be written about the next ten years of my life. Yet as surely
        only my mother is reading at this point, I will only say how blessed I
        am to have been gifted this decade of service, "non-profit" work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        For ten years I got to travel the world, going from Pennsylvania to
        Italy then to Africa and finally to North Carolina. I tried hot wine in
        a wintry Poland. I touched Michelangelo's{" "}
        <span className="italics">Pieta</span> protected behind thick glass
        walls.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        For ten years, I tended to the actively dying, rejoiced at the birth of
        newborns, and gave a clumsy word or two to those plunged in sorrow. I
        saw people come alive after years of internal drudgery; eyes light up
        after decades of darkness; tears roll down cheeks once covered in
        spiritual soot.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Time and time again, others showed me that there is goodness to be
        found, even in the most difficult of circumstances. I understood more
        deeply how we all are woven from the same human tapestry. My perspective
        widened as I worked with others of drastically different backgrounds; my
        inner landscape became more varied and lush.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        And thus I returned to my beloved Spartanburg after those ten years,
        thankful for the graces received, thankful to once again be among family
        and friends... thankful to have returned home.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">TWO ROADS CONVERGE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The year was 2020, and the world, for a while, turned off. I played a
        lot of Stardew Valley while wrestling with COVID for months and then
        pivoted towards a new career. I became a realtor, wedding the previous
        world of finance with the newer one of service work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a realtor, I had to learn to understand my clients' true needs, going
        beyond the surface "what's" to the deeper "why's" from which true
        satisfaction is born. Doing this full-time meant handling multiple
        projects, orchestrating deals to help them reach that dream goal. With
        each success, I sought to do better next time. With each dropped deal, I
        asked where I could have done better, or more.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Returning to social media as a professional necessity, I rapidly grew as
        a content creator. I sought to provide value as I learned impromptu
        marketing. I became a local voice. Thanks to my efforts, I became a
        Planning Commissioner for the City of Spartanburg, one of
        OneSpartanburg, Inc.'s (the 2021 US Chamber of Commerce) first
        Ambassadors for their "Power Up" entrepreneurship oriented program, and
        a source and point of contact for the local news.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Toes were stepped on, lessons learned, and leadership skills sharpened
        as I weighed the needs of individuals within the scope of those of the
        whole.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">AND NOW... A HAPPY TOAST</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Yet what would be the point of all work with no fun?! Hence, while
        juggling all this, I also became a co-creator for the{" "}
        <span className="italics">Spartanburg Cocktail Masters</span>... and at
        the prompting, no less, of a cop! Thanks to that, hundreds of people
        have since gathered in Spartanburg to taste the samples of 15 local
        competitors — all battling it out to be the next Spartanburg Cocktail
        Master, all to support a local cause. For Spartanburg, if you haven't
        noticed, rocks!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The creation of this annual event helped me deepen so many lessons,
        especially as it pertained to managing priorities, expectations, and
        deadlines. Sponsors, vendors, competitors, venues, judges, licenses,
        insurance, laws, and so much more had to be juggled to bring this event
        into existence! And so I learned to delegate what I could not do to those who
        could, and what I <span className="italics">could</span> do to those who
        could do it <span className="italics">better</span>. Due to its success,
        the event has been adopted by a state-wide organization, itself a new
        yet worthwhile challenge that will help the event grow for years to
        come.

        <span className="bold">TO NEW ADVENTURES!</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In the midst of such intense activity, I ended up discovering a true
        love for content creation, having taken art and music classes my whole
        life. My observant brother (a classy geek and bona fide dork) encouraged
        me to take a closer look at coding, knowing it would wash with so many
        fun chemicals my ADHD brain, oh-so-OCD prone. And so I became — at long
        happy last — a software developer, ready to bring greater beauty and
        order to the world through code.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In my spare time, I enjoy hiking with friends, watching others play
        Minecraft, and <span className="italics">not</span> taking long walks on
        the beach, lest the sand get in in-every-which-spot.
