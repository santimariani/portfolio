        Hello, there! My name is Santi, a full-stack developer with a love for
        both beauty and logic and an appetite for continual learning and growth.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        An alumnus of the <span className="italics">Carolina Code School</span>,
        I learned to quickly absorb new technologies and to recognize software
        patterns that have helped me take my ambitions beyond the classroom
        walls. I enjoy building beautiful and functional web platforms, yet also
        the logic that makes for an efficient user experience. For more on the
        evolution of my software development journey, see the Projects section!

        Originally born in Argentina (
        <span className="italics">hablo espa√±ol</span>), I moved to the United
        States in 1996, falling in love with the culture of my new home. After
        having majored in Finance, I devoted the next ten years to service work
        through my church. Grateful for these years of service, I returned to my
        beloved Spartanburg, to be closer to my family, friends, and roots.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Three years ago, I became a realtor, a City of Spartanburg planning
        commisioner, an ambassador for OneSpartanburg, Inc.'s "Power Up"
        program, a growing content creator on my social media platforms, a point
        of contact for local news, a co-creator of the{" "}
        <span className="italics">Spartanburg Cocktail Masters</span> annual
        event, and, at long happy last, a software developer.

        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me! Enjoy your stay. :)
