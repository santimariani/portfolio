        <span className="bold">WHY, HELLO THERE! :)</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        My name is Santi, a full-stack developer with a deep love for beauty and
        logic, a curious eye for innovation and problem-solving, and an
        insatiable appetite for continual learning and growth!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        An alumnus of the <span className="italics">Carolina Code School</span>,
        I learned to quickly absorb new technologies and to recognize those
        software patterns that are helping me take my ambitions beyond the
        classroom walls.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        For the front-end, I was equipped with JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.
        For the back-end, Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Supabase became my
        tools-to-go. On the horizon, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind beckon me
        onward. Not a single dull moment is expected at -any- turn.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        User experience is at the forefront of my every project—unique
        interfaces, an ever-passionate goal! And beyond the visible, I enjoy
        employing sound logic and best principles to create solid apps that go
        above-and-beyond. For more on the evolution of my software development
        journey and to continue the 'techy' branch of my bio, see my{" "}
        <Link to="/projects">Projects</Link> next door!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        With the essentials taken care of, feel free now to keep on reading at
        your own peril, for to do so will mean going knee-deep into the realm of
        Santi Lore. Think twice before doing it! Yet not thrice, lest drama
        queens get bored.
        <br></br>

        <span className="bold">"DON'T CRY FOR ME..."</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Originally born in Argentina (
        <span className="italics">hablo español</span>), I moved to the United
        States in 1996 with my parents and one brother, falling in love with my
        new home. While learning a new language had its immense challenges, it
        taught me the importance of consistency and rewarded me with the
        capacity to understand life through two diverse cultural "modes." As an
        immigrant family, we learned to take nothing for granted — there were no
        generational hand-me-downs; only what could be earned through sweat,
        tears of sacrifice, and hard work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Despite the language barrier, I graduated from Spartanburg High School
        as a Palmetto Fellow Scholar, being in the top 3% of my class. I took
        voice lessons and was <span className="italics">painfully</span>{" "}
        socially awkward. Above all, I made friendships that, since then, have
        only grown. For I am one fortunate soul.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">ENTER—WOFFORD</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        One of my greatest joys in these early years is having attended Wofford
        College, majoring <span className="italics">summa cum laude</span> in
        Finance. There, I became a student leader through the Success Initiative
        program, where I began to understand the fundamentals of
        entrepreneurship. In practice, I discovered within the program a need
        for more efficient communication between the various groups. To solve
        this unperceived need, I created a tailored online-forum — facilitating
        real-time conversations and saving the program thousands of dollars.
        Hence, I earned the{" "}
        <span className="italics">
          Dr. James Proctor Award for Innovation, Creativity, and
          Entrepreneurship
        </span>
        ... and a trend for creative problem-solving was born!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        (I also continued performing as a singer during this time and was even
        the protagonist in a children's opera:{" "}
        <span className="italics">Sid the Serpent Who Wanted to Singp</span>.
        But as I had to wear a leotard for this one, we do not talk about this,
        nay, not even in whispers. Who even -is- this Sid fellow of old?!)
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Balancing my creative outlets, my financial classes helped me to look at
        challenges through more of an analytical mindset. Attention to detail
        became a constant necessity, the application of mathematics a daily
        must. "How boring," some might say. Yet I loved every moment of it! And
        so I earned the{" "}
        <span className="italics">
          Departmental Award for Academic Achievement, Scholarly Promise, and
          Intellectual and Moral Integrity
        </span>
        . I am thus undeniably and irrevocably a 100% certifiable (and
        certified!) nerd, geek, and dork.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">TWO ROADS DIVERGE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        To conclude my time at Wofford, I was selected to go to the Aspen
        Institute as an intern — a first for Wofford, "so make us shine like we
        are among the best!" There, I met world leaders as I did various tasks
        to support the operations of this globally renowned think-tank. On the
        one hand, I was amazed by the human capacity for progress. On the other,
        I noticed how many of the world's wealthiest were still left grappling
        for a deeper meaning to it all.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        "We have everything yet are still unhappy," it was mentioned at a
        private group gathering. "For this problem and answer is yet to be
        found."
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Until then, I had been aspiring to be 'financially free.' This was the
        path to which I had given my all! It was why I had majored in finance.
        It was why I had done my every project. It was why I had accepted this
        internship when even asked at all...
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Yet after hearing that admission, I was forever a changed man, having
        been spared decades of mindless wandering. My heart thus embarked on a
        different adventure. A new path became trod.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">IN PURSUIT OF A GREATER LOVE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Much could be written about the next ten years of my life. Yet as surely
        only my mother is reading at this point, I will only say how blessed I
        am to have been gifted this decade of service, "non-profit" work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        For ten years I got to travel the world, going from Pennsylvania to
        Italy then to Africa and finally to Carolina of North. I tried hot wine
        in a wintry Poland. I touched Michelangelo's{" "}
        <span className="italics">Pieta</span> supposedly protected behind thick
        glass walls.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        For ten years I got to tend to the actively dying, rejoice at the birth
        of newborns, give a clumsy word or two to those plunged in sorrow.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>For ten years I saw people come alive after years of internal
        drudgery; eyes light up after decades of glimpsing in strained darkness;
        tears roll down cheeks once covered in spiritual soot.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Time and time again, others showed me that there is goodness to be
        found, even in the most difficult of circumstances. Those of different
        cultures showed me how we all have one same intrinsic longing... a
        common and equal dignity... a single human fabric from which we are
        woven and made to grow.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        And thus I returned to my beloved Spartanburg after those ten years,
        thankful for the graces received, thankful to once again be among family
        and friends... thankful to once again be among familiar roots from which
        sprung "home."
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">TWO ROADS CONVERGE</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The year was 2020, and the world, for a while, turned off. I played a
        lot of Stardew Valley and afterwards pivoted towards a new career. I
        became a realtor, to wed the previous path of finance with the more
        current one of service work.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        As a realtor, I had to learn to understand my clients' true needs, going
        from the surface "what's" that were presented to the deeper "why's" from
        which satisfaction is born. Doing this full-time meant learning to
        become adept at handling multiple "projects" simultaneously,
        orchestrating deals and practicalities to help them reach that end-dream
        goal. With each success, I sought to then do it better. With each
        dropped deal, I asked myself where I could have done better, or more.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Having returned to social media as a professional necessity, I rapidly
        grew as a content creator. I sought to only provide what was of value as
        I learned the ins and outs of impromptu marketing. I became a local
        voice. And hence, thanks to my efforts and local contributions, I became
        a Planning Commissioner for the City of Spartanburg, one of
        OneSpartanburg, Inc.'s (the 2021 US Chamber of Commerce) first
        Ambassadors for their "Power Up" entrepreneurship program, and a source
        and point of contact for the local news.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Toes were stepped on, lessons learned, and new leadership skills
        acquired as I considered and weighed in the needs of individuals in
        contrast to the needs of the whole.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        So many unique opportunities. I am thankful for it all!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span className="bold">AND NOW... A HAPPY TOAST</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Yet what would be the point of all work and no fun?! Hence, while
        juggling all this, I also became a co-creator for the{" "}
        <span className="italics">Spartanburg Cocktail Masters</span>... and at
        the prompting, no less, of a cop! And so, hundreds of people have been
        drawn in these last two years to our beautiful Spartanburg to taste the
        samples of 15 local competitors — who in turn battle it out to be the
        next Spartanburg Cocktail Master, all to support a local cause. For
        Spartanburg, if you haven't noticed, downright rocks.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        The creation of this annual event helped me learn so many lessons—both
        as a leader and simultaneously a member of the group—especially as it
        pertained to managing priorities, expectations, and deadlines. Sponsors,
        vendors, competitors, venues, judges, licenses, insurance, laws, and so
        much more had to be juggled to bring this event to life! And so I
        learned to delegate what I could not do to those who could, and what I{" "}
        <span className="italics">could</span> do to those who could do it{" "}
        <span className="italics">better</span>. Due to its success, the event
        has been adopted by a state-wide organization, which -itself- was a new
        challenge, yet a most worthwhile one, that the event may grow for years
        to come.

        <span className="bold">TO NEW ADVENTURES!</span>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In the midst of such intense activity, I ended up discovering a true
        love for content creation, having taken art and music classes my whole
        life. My observant brother (a classy geek and bona fide dork) encouraged
        me to take a closer look at coding, knowing it would wash with so many
        fun chemicals my ADHD brain, oh-so-OCD prone. And so I became — at long
        happy last — a software developer, ready to bring greater beauty and
        order to the world through code.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In my spare time, I enjoy hiking with friends, watching others play
        Minecraft, and <span className="italics">not</span> taking long walks on
        the beach, lest the sand get in in-every-which-spot.
