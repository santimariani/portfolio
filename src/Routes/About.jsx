        Hi, there, hello! My name is Santi, a full-stack developer with a love for
        both beauty and logic and an appetite for continual learning and growth.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Originally born in Argentina (
        <span className="italics">hablo espa√±ol</span>), I moved to the United
        States in 1996, falling in love with the culture of my new home.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        After having majored in Finance, I devoted the next ten years to service
        work through my church. Grateful for these years of service, I returned
        to my beloved Spartanburg, to be closer to my family, friends, and
        roots.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Then, in the last three years, I became a realtor, a City of Spartanburg
        planning commisioner, an ambassador for OneSpartanburg, Inc.'s "Power
        Up" program, a growing content creator on my social media platforms, a
        point of contact for local news, a co-creator of the{" "}
        <span className="italics">Spartanburg Cocktail Masters</span> annual
        event, and, at long happy last, a software developer.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Thank you for taking the time to get to know me! Enjoy your stay. :)
