# Personal Portfolio

<b>TECH</b>: React • React Router • Dynamic Resizing

For my personal portfolio, I created a website that feels like business card, as it cannot be scrolled in any direction. Instead, the content is provided in the middle by using React Router, to make for a unique user experinece. This was my first attempt at creating a unique domain, hosting a website, and linking the two realities. It is also my first attempt at creating a website that works on both laptop and mobile, a feat I hopefully pulled off!
